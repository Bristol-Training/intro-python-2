Starting from the initial code:

```{python}
my_list = [5, 7, 34, 5, 3, 545]

big_numbers = []
for num in my_list:
    if num > 10:
        big_numbers.append(num)

print(big_numbers)
```

We pull out the middle four lines, indent them, put `def big(numbers):` in front and add `return big_numbers` to the end, paying careful attention to the indentation of the `return` statement. Finally, we update the variable name used in the function to match the argument name `numbers`:

```{python}
def big(numbers):
    big_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num > 10:
            big_numbers.append(num)
    return big_numbers


my_list = [5, 7, 34, 5, 3, 545]

large_numbers = big(my_list)

print(large_numbers)
```
