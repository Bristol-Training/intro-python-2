To get input from the person running your code, you can use the function [`input()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input). And to get the length of your variable you can call [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len).



```{python}
my_name = input("Please tell me your name: ")
name_length = len(my_name)
print(f"Hello {my_name}! Your name is {name_length} characters long")
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
my_name = "Jean"

print("Please tell me your name:", my_name)

name_length = len(my_name)

print(f"Hello {my_name}! Your name is {name_length} characters long")
```
