```{python}
sounds = {"cat": "meow", "dog": "woof", "horse": "neigh"}

dog_sound = sounds["dog"]
horse_sound = sounds["horse"]

print("Dog goes", dog_sound)
print("Horse goes", horse_sound)
```




If we edit our code so that it asks for a key that doesn't exist, we will see an error being produced:



```{python}
#| error: true
sounds = {"cat": "meow", "dog": "woof", "horse": "neigh"}

fish_sound = sounds["fish"]

print(fish_sound)
```
