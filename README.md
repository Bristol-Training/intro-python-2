This project is built with Quarto (https://quarto.org). Dependencies
are managed using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (installation
instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Once uv is installed, you can render local changes with:

```
uv run quarto preview
```
